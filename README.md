# Emre Nitim

## Introduction
Hello! I'm Emre Nitim, a computer engineering student with a passion for artificial intelligence and game development. I have experience with various programming languages and technologies, and I'm always eager to learn and explore new tools and frameworks.

## Skills and Expertise
- Languages: C, Java, C#, JavaScript, Python, Assembly, Pascal, Prolog
- Technologies:
  - Unity Game Engine: Developed two games, one focusing on underwater exploration with procedural terrain generation using the Marching Cubes algorithm and boids algorithm, and another with a multiplayer space game utilizing Reinforcement Learning agents and server-authoritative FishNet networking solution.
  - ML-Agents: Trained intelligent spaceship weapons and movement agents using Reinforcement Learning.
  - Processing: Familiar with this creative coding platform.
- Addon Development: Developed popular Java addons for the ProjectKorra plugin in Minecraft, with over 40,000 downloads. These addons feature special abilities based on the Avatar: The Last Airbender theme.

## Projects and Achievements
- [Underwater Exploration Game](https://github.com/emrenitim/underwater-exploration-game): A Unity-based game showcasing procedural terrain generation using the Marching Cubes algorithm and boids algorithm for underwater environments.
- [Multiplayer Space Game](https://github.com/emrenitim/multiplayer-space-game): A multiplayer space game with enemy ships controlled by Reinforcement Learning agents, utilizing a server-authoritative multiplayer system and FishNet networking solution. Additionally, I created a random star system with procedurally generated planets.
- [NeuroEvolution Asteroid Game](https://github.com/emrenitim/neuroevolution-asteroid-game): I developed both the asteroid game and the AI components. The project involved creating a JavaScript-based asteroid game, and then implementing and training an agent using the NeuroEvolution algorithm to play the game effectively.

## Learning and Interests
Currently, I'm expanding my knowledge in Unity and ML-Agents, and I'm also interested in exploring alternative game engines and tools that combine AI and game development.
